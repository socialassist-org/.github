## Hi, and welcome to SocialAssist.org on GitHub

The idea of SocialAssist.org is to use modern web, cloud, and mobile technology to create a platform to enable vulnerable people or people with health concerns to easily configure actionable plans or alerts to request assistance when in need. Or notify loved ones, family, or friends when an event occurs, such as being hispitalised.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
